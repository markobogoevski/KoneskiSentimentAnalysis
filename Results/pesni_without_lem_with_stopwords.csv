181,poem the evening of september attic of a tall house in the busy sofia street that is the apartment of the poet kole nedelkovski he sits at the table flipping through the collection of miladinovci carried away in some thought racin walking around the room is currently stopped in front of an open window lights over the city all the way to the distance like some kind of low sky it feels like a pleasant breath from the nearby garden through the roofs only a soft noise that calms and closes the loneliness reaches up kole his gaze stops he reads to himself and then loudly with a gesture towards racina he repeats the verses my son goes to the lake to pour me pearl water pearl water i see that living water mournful with my heart not with my lips i would drink it from a white handful of a girl when pouring lest you know what is in it a well sun white dove caressing go boy to the lake how i look blue long and after her another quiet spread and so on to the distance until complete calm and the thought that follows it more and more calm it melts there with something wide with a fresh and lavish soul i do not know but for me it is most intimate touch with the homeland racin and it lasts a moment ah distant sight another noise i hear noise of blood that is always in us noise of red stormy lakes behind the edge of which always some sun rises or sets homeland through that noise question forever how in life how about people with love and hate how about yourself easy answer in a word beautifully worded relevant to all relevant to everywhere heavy when countless times one has to give it the homeland see what a thought peer she is ours we grow it in ourselves mortal and thirsty for eternity her which should be eternal the look in the heart glow in the night vortex and her word we are already before the act quite unstoppable excitement of the songs do not bury me in the frog of lukewarm souls do not leave a cobweb to envelop me in hesitant hearts i am the sun i love my sunrise i seek freedom choose her ah like a wind to pass my breath over the may rye and that waving to surrender to the grasses to be handed over to the leaves on the plains on the ridges of the mountains and beyond to be handed over to the lakes to be a sweet chill to the end for the strength of our whole country homeland she is not calm nor a lake calm the fate of our lives is hard fidelity requires forward when he sends us of the fallen after our crumbs to ourselves to find meaning already the victim how will i proceed cole i once said it all before to be faithful in the difficult days our peer what a beautiful how engaged love sounds with everything i hide in secret out of yourself i belong to her at the hour judged for that love how would i stand before death in the pupil how would i look at her uncertainty but one has to be prepared and it seems to me that i m getting ready i have a weird feeling after being resolved from weakness it is i know in everything my thought demands the sadness of parting bitter enjoyment i want to see a swallow nest when the mother feeds the naked chickens a full singing heart then looks like me but i remember the cost in front of the wind and his deaf sad sigh the first night when it is empty abandoned by its inhabitants i want to walk through ripe wheat at dawn before the beginning of the harvest when at one end the harvesters already rolled up their sleeves and the sickle shines with the first sun then the fields are still full of secrets full whisper between the spike and the flowers but the quail excited about its eggs does not teach her well in the evening she will be a mourning stubble i want a smile for the girl i met by chance caught passing by who knows how alive from the stack of thoughts only hers i love him because of the complaint which is unique and what is immediately the first and last greeting that s why the song moved me so much for the lake boy that s why i came up with it so vividly clear water in a handful of girls poetry is pure that water but if it does not drink the thirsty heart of man it will be drunk by the thirsty heart of the sun or the country dew after dew ah that water is just a moment which gathered everything from light freshness and beauty in one palm and what dies with all its beauty racin tell me do you think they are so close to us and is that a premonition and a thirst i long for living electricity too but if it is so an estuary that does not exist which has no end that it does not flow on the sand white pebbles sinking and not through the grass laughing playful and playful although lukewarm tranquility awaits her no it flows from heart to heart as much as hearts make the people ah think of it the width of that trough it flows into countless waterfalls close from the hearts of the ancients in the hearts of children in knee reconstruction ah think of it the infinity of that flow sweet whisper sweet splash dressings of the sun and moon night stories and noise which frightens in the distance and rainbow drunkenness in a boil of foams and all that in human breasts i crave that current poetry you know the old tale two hills were beaten they will share their breath and rot force by force they collapse with sharp teeth as if slaughtered with teeth and fire burst forth from the scribble and among them in the middle in a bow well of living water any pain subsides any wound heals who will drink from it he has no dying and such a hero was found to cheat the strength of the mountains to withstand the heat of their congestion from living water to bring out in the calm light the day it starts and behold it seems to me we have embarked on the same struggle to draw living water between two rolling hills to infuse it into people s hearts the living water of poetry in rebellion today she is to rise to sacrifice a small and suffering people to shout and the word immediately becomes deed oh we need to be strong in spirit children of a small repressed tribe in the storm of the world of the homeland what makes sense we give it the first free form of poetry creators the first of the hearts we spring from and where is it in us is it there the strength of that ancient hero you know the debt but small to remember scary are those suspicions strange who will forgive us who will come to life with our soul and then when will we be gone kole he approached him while this conversation was going on and now the two of them are facing each other facing the night frame of the window give me your hand shut up enough it s a sweet and weird hour for me soul by soul as if overflowing like the waves of a lake farther and farther to that complete calm like canopies when they stop from pouring and two twins in them just fell asleep you know the debt and you have hope in the act of sacrifice ah beautiful and unexpected of life are the games nothing more just a shiver of grass the ant walking like excited but we are happy again before any parting that s enough power our faith our faithfulness for those after us to give of heart measure pity those who were those who go and thirsty for the truth that in their hearts it knocks rushing towards her however such a time is coming where she is do not know in black fiery restlessness are lost how i cried with screams on a winter night opaque you see the book there where did the word come from tonight remember how that poet died in a damp dungeon alone where the eyes of the mortal were light unique to see ohrid to see struga if that tune sent him how hopeless it sounded desolate to him his song and you can it just seemed to him to exhale that dies from the heart torn without a trace of man and nobody anything for one life will not know and yet how many times did he exhale and poured out our souls and how close this man is to us i feel it with us tonight as if he were alive here turns abruptly as if he were going to the window his gaze is gentle and inviting quiet smile happy though afflicted on the lips he still only sees me i give him the sleeve ah how sweet how longawaited handshake he shakes passes with his palms over his eyes and again glowing turns to racina ghost someone will mention us like this but you are here i can really hug you my dear friend hugs him live be cheerful to experience all the joy of this hour at least this is not a hug for
