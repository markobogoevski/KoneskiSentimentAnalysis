""Masters, hear a story about my son,
and you hear, young sons!
An empty soul mourns for him,
for him my chest tears ...
I understand how he was left an orphan,
in the cradle still, a young falcon alone.
How I sighed, how I gathered
to see it, I know one.
In my arms the child grew,
I was his caring and strict father
and as a mother I prayed aloud
to save me from disease god.
I think of him fondly in memory
the first gear, and word, and ôd.
But how we slept next to each other -
there was pain in the memory ...
My hero slept,
he smiled sweetly in his sleep,
but the dark night was desolate
persecuted for his father.
I lay torn without a drop of power
and a hot drill went deep in the mind,
I was rolling hard on the bed hard,
and I heard in my ears a horrible noise,
and I loved my own death.
Because the world has given me trouble,
to be suffering for a crust of bread,
to be hungry my child,
and the roof was torn down and the fire blinded.
And my Christmas to be sad,
to nap misery on my floor,
and I do not have a wet look
to remember joy never.
Argotic life like a angry snake
to crush strength, to drink.
And it was often so strange to me
for my son's sweet dream,
with a quiet smile as he smiles
he played in childhood dreams.
I'm glad my strength is small,
my breath caresses me, it burns me with fervor,
and I'm weird, and I'm sorry
and core tears flow non-stop.
My son has grown up, he has become tall,
a flame flashed in the eyes of manhood;
darkened forehead in youth wound,
and a hard thought descended there.
His path went through a struggle,
torments the enemy in prison without sin.
I struggled in vain to understand it,
he was a falcon, I was a slave!
And when a call came to us
to become a people in a bloody battle,
in a forest with first shift
then my son also got up!
Three angry winters, three leafy summers
with a rifle in his hands he went into agony,
and the world he walked in rose up
with a board company through death and famine.
A gray falcon flies through the smoke and flames
without light wings to live ostriches,
not a bullet whistled by a wicked curse
reached him in flight young.
And when the third year passed
and already the enemy was fleeing in misery,
at the bridge here, promised death,
he fell dead near his hometown.
He fell dead from a filthy hand,
he shed red blood here,
and his rear gaze faded here
like a clear star behind a dark tip.
I waited last night to hear a step,
to knock my son on my porch,
but the night was deaf and soft,
and the echo stalled and the road dumb.
I found him that day at the bridge dismembered,
with other falcons in fellow death.
His hair was strangely smooth,
I caressed her for a long time with my palm hard.
And after the burial passed through the city,
people were walking, a choir was singing:
Let it be celebrated that the hero died
for his people, a sublime pine ...
And then something caught me, picked me up,
my city was very tense,
and as if another world changed the world, -
and a tear for the first time.
No pain, she revealed a miracle to me,
for what my hero longed for,
what every fighter knows
when he dies,
what every man keeps secret
deep in the heart - the most beautiful gift,
but instead of fire to shine bright,
which often smolders - a raging ember.
Freedom - so much that I struggled,
which means I understood that strange word.
And he was buried. Dark above the grave
people stood, a choir sang.
And then I said: My son, goodbye,
let the earth be cold to you!
I will raise it for an eternal memory
the bridge in youth where it fell!
Masters, you have children,
hear father's oath and curse,
young men, I see my son in you,
his hardness shines in your eyes:
To bend everyone. It needs to be built
the bridge! Hard steel let it scream!
Blood in the foundation lay. And such a building
neither a century destroys it, nor a storm destroys it!

Oh difficult! Surli as soon as they scream wildly,
as soon as the drum thunders with an underground echo -
in the breasts why sadly angry squeezes me,
in the eyes why a river flows
and why I feel like crying like a child,
to fold my arms, to cover my face -
I bite my lips, I tighten my heart, damn it,
not to let out a shout.
Oh difficult! The old men are coming out here,
thought on their foreheads, moisture in their eyes
and the first step on soft grass
is calm and slow, with restrained sadness.
But the drum breaks and the scream rises
and lightning flashes in every sight,
and goes forward, shoots, pours
tight order.
The old men jump to the old men;
did not last heart - gray falcon in a cell,
he could not stand the flame alive in his eye,
he could not stand the youth that wants to fly!
She got lost dancing! The ground turned,
and it seems - the stressed century is coming to an end,
and around the stagnant hills dark
and return ek.
And as if the stunt dance had started
with primordial power for our country
and in it forests the rivers the word,
and there was a wild and terrible wind
and ripe grains whisper in it
and the evening odor wafts quietly,
and the earth breathes in spring satiety
with a burning breath.
And the soul, it seems, of my genus tormented
in a difficult dance everything was lost -
century after century that accumulated everything discounted and gloomy
from bloody pain, from prison woe,
century after century that descended from the hard thought
for a joyful child, for a free world,
from a song - for love that dies with a scream
like a crane in flight.
Oh difficult! When I look at you in silence,
fog hits my eyes sura,
and suddenly - the order stretches endlessly
and hills are lost in the desolate wasteland -
and here it comes from the murky fog
everything shadow to shadow, everything to each other -
in endless dance son goes after father,
after you are a grandfather - a nephew.
Dark times are their field,
and their whistle - on the shackles the rattle,
and their heads are down,
and they go straight - everything step by step.
O times when my family has passed away in the dark,
what word will you find for your passion ?!
What word will he find to me about the horror zinat
over desolation and blood ?!
What number will tell me the angry wounds,
on blazing nights, on brown ashes,
who will arrange the pains of the heart gathered,
and tears in the eyes, and curses in the mouth?
Oh difficult! Your chain was a slave,
from girls and brides,
with his hands tied in the prey he had carried
the bully cursed.
Oh difficult! Your chain was a slave,
until he became a people in a leafy mountain,
all even with the misery of centuries gathered
did not lead a lush, rebellious dance!
A dance ran through blood and fire,
and a call was heard and thunder in the smoke -
the rebellious leg blew you everywhere
on the birth floor.
Oh difficult! Now in our villages
in freedom the first time I meet a dance,
is it strange - a tear to flow hot,
Is it strange - a complaint I remember in my heart ?!
From centuries of slavery, my people, you go
but you carry in your hands a gift of gold and a song.
Your wheat bran will be fruitful,
and your life!",0.5123090909090908,0.49979999999999997,0.48666363636363597,0.34545454545454546,0.12727272727272726,0.16818181818181818,0.10454545454545454,0.5848260869565217,0.05909090909090909,0.5366153846153846,0.07272727272727272,0.44050000000000006,0.15,0.543969696969697,0.15,0.4851212121212121,0.1318181818181818,0.6161379310344828,0.05909090909090909,0.5596923076923077,0.10909090909090909,0.46770833333333334

Last night sadly through the darkness
jaor wood was roaring.
I just lay down, I fell asleep alone,
I have a strange dream.
I dream of a dark fog,
in the fog to two falcons,
pearls crumble from the wings.
Say, mother, old mother,
what kind of show is it?
- Heavy Koba, court trouble
Kobe, son, your dream:
dark fog - dark dungeon,
to two falcons - to two brothers,
crushed pearl - a small chain.

Ambush wolf at dusk dawn
by a mountain road ...
And a short shot and a thunderous echo,
and then - peace and gunpowder smoke ...
... The seven fighters who fell at dawn
wear them
in Prilep
on the square.
Suddenly the news -
black bird
screamed over the city with a wailing cry.
Breathlessness and malice
through the streets
the executioner passes.
Stick after stitch.
It bites a stone on the heels,
shot him deadly by all persons
the city
rebel.
And he heard sad news about his son
the father will not break the threshold,
not even a brother with a dark face will pass
to see his dead brother.
No
There was a pain that broke my heart,
Revenge against him in a men's city!
But how can a wretched mother last?
He bit a snake,
pain all over ...
A black scarf ties her
and runs there with a standing breath
goodbye back to my son ...
The day is dark. It rained.
Discount and quiet is the square.
Seven lie in a bloody row.
Guards guard erected above them,
cynically lit bayonet.
And behold, she came running,
and die over them,
it was dark ...
But if fog fell in her eyes,
with a heart his mother knew he suffered
saw him dead son you are young.
She twisted her fingers in horror
and covered character.
It all shook like a weak reed
and tense breasts ...
But from the chest
no vile was heard,
tearful shout.
And only a tear poured down his cheek
over a dead machine ...
And in a moment
co veda
it shone brightly
mindless thought,
but thought wild:
No!
He is not!
And then the mother opened her eyes,
a view passing over a corpse and mud,
and how I cried without way and rest
which sinks in the sky with a quiet sorrow.
The heavy stone melts in my heart,
and sees mother new, strange end,
and he sees his son alive there
as in a dream you keep.
She saw him at dawn
on a mountain ridge,
of all first, -
column where from partisans
reaches a high mountain peak ...
The blue space swings under them.
In the morning purple the sky sinks.
And her son shone there
before a rosy sunrise
in eagle flight ...
It's a song -
the mountains are ringing,

Take grass under you, with a secret thought,
with winter it grows, it grows.
And in the spring spring green and clear
on lush springs place.
My life has been fruitful
with you, father country.
In the chest, as in a furrow, with a quiet laugh
your seed sprouts from me.
With your vineyards in the foliage one
I breathe blue sky.
This is the first time I see you with such love,
wheat, field native!
And what a sonic joy it awakens in me
the bridge we make.
And your flight takes me strange,
O born, free end of me!
And now that my song is ripe,
I know who to tell -
to my people who sing wildly,
who sings in a starry night.
O my youth! Do not think in the spring
for your part and happiness -
with rye lush in a wide field
sprouts and blue flowers.
To your people with a strong gait
and your ecstasy is coming.

- two trains in breath race
how they met in the dark -
and if you say then
for a bloody moonrise
above a dark mountain peak
for red beam,
in a strange tale is heard
sorrow of a wounded soul.
It is not possible to lie,
you are really angry -
your own shame and sorrow
hide it in a vague song.

I love this place next to Sava
in the hour of dusk, of a standing noise.
Like the water on that river
and my spirit floweth with serenity.
I often came down from Kalemegdan
on the stairs under the old damp vault
to this peaceful place in the evening,
to the whisper of those quiet waters.
But how much time, what time has passed
from the days when I walked here alone!
You went, he said, to a blue distance
and a youth tekla without remembering.
And here I go again at dusk
on the shore river along a path known;
something made me want to be something
like a man who listens to a secret.
Everything is quieter, the rate is cut
and like a wave my life flows
with the rhythm of that wide river,
on that calm evening with the breath.
And I'm just a light wave,
splashes, forests, calms down, lasts,
and even if a dark nectar drags him,
but he still knows the essence.
I run, I run ... And my feet
I hear them alone on the shore like in a dream,
I'm a wave cold from hugged drops
and I sink like a sinking song.
And submissive to that blue song
I rise up so I love the shore.

did I take something and am I losing something?

I have been listening to them for an eternity
and I do not say: you desolate, youth, extinguished

On a pre-autumn slope, on Vodno,
with a slight sun and fragrant secrecy,
the three of us were lying on our backs, staring at the sky,
three ancient bodies
that they have lost their vitality.
The heat of the earth was merciful
and the acacias that withered were not against us, -
and that light blue, calmer to the height
and farther and farther,
leads the gaze, and blue spots obscure it.
And we were already completely in it, torn
from the weight that lifts us, -
following endlessly a purple hue
which promises to distribute everything
for the smiling, experienced, wisdom guy.
But the thread became thinner and painless
broke off,
and we were slightly pushed in front of the secret doors,
left to the mercy of the pre-autumn sun
which understands everyone
and what with consolation.
Then we exchanged two or three ordinary words
which return to the ground and sound effortless.
And we were pleased that we could bribe him
the back of the mature slope
by hand.
And when we were done, the sun was setting,
and all the windows of the city below us were illuminated
pupils,
and, hopefully, our steps walked lightly
along the way,

Cursed be the hour when they told me
that the church in Nebregovo is being demolished!
Thousands of mourners seemed to have begun
to vote and mourn
in me
then
as if coming out of a dark underworld.
To my very childhood, then,
his last veins are destroyed,
and here are diggers and my deepest root,
and as if I had warned him that
I have been suffering from anxiety for a long time
and I have been tired for a long time.
And not that little church
with naively painted hell,
with devils kicking the witch of the witch,
but my own strength is crumbling, I would say,
to resonate in the ruins
crying.
And my first years as a student, at six summers,
and my first Saint Sava
in the yard of that same church,
whose eyelid
so clean
still ringing in the memory,
when in it some imaginary wave,
and those colored candies
in boards and plates on our graves,
that the village gives to its children, -
all that, all that
suddenly
sinks into the wilderness.
Even the birds circling over that church,
the crows and ravens in my memory,
even they
now
when the church collapses
they became like a mere ornament to heaven,
part of a stationary engraving,
and their flight is limited and slum.
The church in Nebregovo is being demolished,
the little church that ever
a bold village spirit made her,
and there is nothing I can do
even though I was sitting out of it
and I am another crushed Abel.
My covenant church is falling apart, hey people,
my graves are falling apart,
and to cry in vain for help
when someone else is someone else
and it can not hurt anyone
what I,
which I sob from the lungs themselves.
But still I,
I raise a curse
over the hour he told me that
the church in Nebregovo is demolished.
The scalded harvest is scanty at that hour
and its ugly meaning.
Next to that church
on Christmas Eve and Vasilica
in snow and ice
fires were lit.
of the calendars and vassals,

on my father's shoulders
with eyes glowing in the dark
the game of shadows
of the flames
I layered it in myself

on summer holidays
in the middle of the village, on the meadow
the old people would be surprised,
and in front of them was dancing
and competitions,
throwing rocks and jumping,
and there was no end to the songs and laughter.
Next to that church
our faith in the future was born,
our hope in the beriket
and in the power of truth.

now
becomes ashes

which made us strong.
And here it becomes powder and chaff

now
collapses

and I collapse
lit and
miserable.

there is nothing to save you!

are changed

which was essential
